# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Zoomable icicle diagram for the system-prompt inspector: flexbox bars
  (one row per visible depth level, each bar sized proportionally to its
  section's character count) with click-to-zoom into subparts and a
  breadcrumb trail back out, available alongside the existing Pretty/Raw
  toggle. Each bar shows a bold section name and, in smaller text below,
  its character count and share of the current zoomed-in view as a
  percentage; a name too long for its bar is clipped with an ellipsis.
  Built with plain CSS so it fills all available width and its text
  always renders at true size, with no JavaScript-driven layout
  measurement.

### Fixed

  throughout app UI text and documentation.

### Added
